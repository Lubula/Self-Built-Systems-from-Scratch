# Self-Built-Systems-from-Scratch
This repository is a compilation of well-written code re-creating my favorite technologies from scratch

## Projects:

3. [Builing A Convolutional Neural Networks from Scrath.ipynb Built Using Pytorch](https://github.com/Lubula/Technology-Systems-Built-from-Scratch/blob/main/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)
4. [Training a Neural Network with Momentum](https://github.com/Lubula/Technology-Systems-Built-from-Scratch/blob/main/4.%20Training%20A%20Neural%20Network%20with%20Momentum.ipynb)
   - Implemented gradient descent with momentum for faster convergence.
