# Technology Systems Built from Scratch
This repository is a collection of projects where I recreate popular AI/ML architectures and algorithms entirely from scratch ‚Äî focusing on understanding the mathematics, data flow, and implementation details that make them work.

## üéØ Goals of This Repo
- Gain an intuitive understanding of how ML models actually work.
- Bridge the gap between theory and practical coding.
- Build confidence in coding models without relying on pre-built libraries.
- Serve as reference code for interviews, research, and learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn
-  Keras/Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/
- PyTorch (only where explicitly noted)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)/ Rasa
- Jupyter Notebook
